\chapter{Timing Calibration of the AHCAL}
\label{chap:TimingCalib}

To perform the timing calibration of the AHCAL, the complete muon dataset is used. Table \ref{table:mu_elec_runs} summarizes the runs and datasets used. Raw events are considered if the reference signals T$_{12}$,  T$_{13}$ and T$_{14}$ are present in the event. Raw events are the number of events after the MIP selection. Selected events are counted after the selection on the error of the time reference as explained in section \ref{section:time_ref}.

The timing calibration is performed in several steps and will be explained in the following sections.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Determination of the timing slope to convert TDC value to nanoseconds.
	\item Calibration of the time reference
	\item Non-linearity correction
	\item Time-walk correction
\end{itemize}

\section{Slope calibration}
\label{subsec:slope_calib}

The data analysis is performed in several steps. The first step is the calibration of the time provided by the \textit{SPIROC2B} chip. To reconstruct the time of the first hit in a channel (only a single hit per channel is registered during a bunch-crossing), the TDC value measured needs to be converted into nanoseconds. The value is converted using the following equations:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:slope}
	\text{slope}_{chip, BXID} \: \text{[ns/TDC]} = \frac{3920 \: \text{ns}}{\text{Max}_{chip, BXID} - \text{Pedestal}_{chip, BXID}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:time_chn}
	\text{T}_{chn} \: \text{[ns]} = \text{slope}_{chip, BXID} \times (\text{TDC} - \text{Pedestal}_{mem=1} )
\end{equation}

The slopes are calculated separately for odd and even BXID due to the chip design presenting two voltage ramps, one for each BXID parity. The determination of the parameter $\text{slope}_{chip, BXID}$ is assuming that the TDC ramp in the chip is linear to a first order. The parameters Max$_{chip, BXID}$ and Pedestal$_{chip, BXID}$ in eq.\ref{eq:slope} are extracted from the TDC spectrum for a specific chip and BXID using only the first memory cell as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:TDC_Spectrum}. At the same time, the parameter Pedestal$_{mem=1}$ in eq.\ref{eq:time_chn} is extracted from the spectrum for each channel and the first memory cell of a chip without taking into account the BXID of the ramp. The difference between both pedestals and for the other memory-cells will be corrected for at a later stage. This is accounting for a total of 208 slopes and 3744 pedestals to be extracted for the testbeam setup.

The reason is not totally understood but present on all chips on that layer.}
\end{figure}
The technique of extraction is based on an edge detection method. For each chip and BXID, a histogram is filled with the y value of each bin. Then the mean of this histogram is defined as a threshold $\mu$. The parameter Pedestal$_{chip, BXID}$ is extracted as the first bin above 30\% of $\mu$. For the parameter Max$_{chip, BXID}$, it is extracted as the last bin above 50\% of the highest bin $BinMax$ of the original histogram. The maximum seems not to be exactly at the last bin of the spectrum, this is due to the technique that needed to be robust against strange spectra as shown in figure \ref{fig:TDC_Spectrum_bad}.
An estimation of the uncertainties on the pedestal $\sigma_{Ped}$ and maximum $\sigma_{Max}$ is done by the following formulas:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:errorPed}
	\begin{aligned}
		\sigma_{Ped} \: = & \: \text{max}(\left|\text{FirstBinAbove}(\mu - RMS) \times 0.3 - \text{Pedestal}_{chip, BXID}\right|, \\
		& \left|\text{FirstBinAbove}(\mu + RMS) \times 0.3 - \text{Pedestal}_{chip, BXID}\right|)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:errorMax}
	\begin{aligned}
		\sigma_{Max} \: = & \: \text{max}(\left|\text{LastBinAbove}(BinMax - 0.33 \times BinMax) \times 0.5 - \text{Max}_{chip, BXID}\right|, \\
		& \left|\text{LastBinAbove}(BinMax - 0.33 \times BinMax) \times 0.5 - \text{Max}_{chip, BXID}\right|)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
More details about the estimation of the calibration uncertainties is described in the appendix \ref{appendix:calib_error}. The extracted values for the slopes are shown in figure \ref{fig:slope_time}. They are in the expected range of 1.6 ns per TDC bin due to the limited dynamic range provided by the chip (around 2500 bins for 4 $\mu$s).

\end{figure}

\section{Calibration of the time reference}
\label{section:time_ref}

To reconstruct the time of the first hit in a channel, the measured time of a hit needs to be compared to the time of a reference trigger. The trigger signals described in subsection \ref{subsec:trigger} are calibrated using the same method as explained above with the addition that the values for all memory cells are extracted separately, possible due to the high statistics in these channels, for these channels to guaranty the most accurate result.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

	\caption{\subref{fig:DeviationProfileT0s} .\subref{fig:Corr_T12T14}) The top left plot shows the time correlation between the references T$_{12}$ and T$_{14}$ after correction. An additional cut on the time between 500 and 3500 ns is done. The bottom plot show the profile of the difference between them.}
\end{figure}

After time calibration of the calorimeter hits, events are selected by requiring that T$_{12}$, T$_{13}$ and T$_{14}$ are present in the event in a certain amplitude range (table \ref{table:T0_sel}) to reject noise hits from these channels. In addition, as these channels receive exactly the same signal from the NIM-logic at the same time, a correction is applied to ensure that they match in time. The correction is performed by correcting the time of T$_{12}$ and T$_{13}$ compared to the time of T$_{14}$ as shown in figure \ref{fig:DeviationProfileT0s}.
After correction, the figure \ref{fig:Corr_T12T14} shows the correlation between T$_{12}$ and T$_{14}$. The figure \ref{fig:T0_Correction} shows that the correction reduces the difference of the trigger channels w.r.t to each other. This is certainly due to the fact that a different value of the pedestal is needed for each BXID parity which was not expected. The resulting width of the reference trigger signal is around 4-5 ns. This resolution from the electronics contributes to the final timing resolution obtained.

The two visible peaks in blue are due to pedestal values being different dependent of the bunch-crossing parity. \subref{fig:T0ReferenceError}}
\end{figure}

In a next step, to reduce the uncertainty made on the time of the trigger, the time reference $T_{ref}$ is calculated using the mean of T$_{12}$, T$_{13}$ and T$_{14}$ and its associated uncertainty $\sigma_{ref}$ as shown in eq. \ref{eq:tref} \& \ref{eq:tref_err}. A cut of 4 ns is performed on $\sigma_{ref}$ to reject events with a too large uncertainty on the time of the trigger reference as shown in figure \ref{fig:T0ReferenceError}. Finally only hits with a calibrated time value between 500 and 3500 were considered to avoid ramp edge effects.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tref}
	\text{T}_{ref} = \frac{\text{T}_{12} + \text{T}_{13} + \text{T}_{14}}{3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tref_err}
	\sigma_{ref}^2 = \frac{ (\text{T}_{12} - \text{T}_{ref})^2 + (\text{T}_{13} - \text{T}_{ref})^2  + (\text{T}_{14} - \text{T}_{ref})^2 }{6}
\end{equation}

\section{Determination of the time of the first hit}

Since the absolute time between the passage of a muon and the trigger of a channel is not known a priori due to cabling and the trigger electronics, the time offset relative to the trigger is determined from data. Muons are quasi-instantaneous particles thus the time of the first hit distribution for each channel, memory cells and BXID should peak at \textit{t=0}. This shifting procedure takes into account the delay time of the trigger due to cabling and the NIM-logic as well as possible mis-calibrations in pedestals. Only memory-cells containing more than 100 events are considered. This is achieved getting the maximum bin for each channel and memory-cell and iteratively changing the range of the histogram until the RMS of the distribution is under 10 ns. This value was arbitrary chosen. Once an RMS under 10 is reached, the mean of the histogram is taken as the offset value. In a second step, non-prompt events are tagged by requiring at least 4 prompt hits in the range of -20 to 20 ns to account for a possible miscalibration in the first step of determining the offset. This was necessary to remove noisy channels and ensure a good calibration of the offset. The procedure is iterated then once again with the non-prompt events removed and the offset is extracted using the same method as described above.

In this way, 18338 individual offsets are extracted from data. A distribution of the extracted offsets using muon data can be seen in figure \ref{fig:offset_trigger_distribution}. The mean value of -150 ns is in the expected order for the cabling and NIM-logic delay. The figure \ref{fig:BXID_offset} shows that individual offsets have to be extracted for each BXID parity and indicates that a pedestal value per BXID parity is needed to be taken into account in the calibration.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Time of the first hit distribution}

After the selection and calibration, the time of the first hit (T$_{fH}$) can be obtained by plotting the distribution of T$_{chn}$ - T$_{ref}$ as shown in figure \ref{fig:timing_nocorrection}. The time resolution (RMS) shown in figure \ref{fig:timing_nocorrection} obtained by combining all layers excluding layer 11 is around 5.65 ns by just applying the time calibration on the data. This is far from the desired time resolution of 1 ns. Some improvements are still possible as described in the following. An asymmetry can be seen in the time distribution to the left. It is likely coming from the non-linearity of the TDC ramp as explained in the next subsection.

Each layer was also looked at individually as shown in figure \ref{fig:reso_nocorrection}. A comparison between a Gaussian fit to extract the $\sigma$ and the RMS of the distribution is done. All layers are very similar in terms of time resolution and Gaussian-like. The layer 6 and 10 present a higher time resolution that may be due to the bad quality and the low number of working channels of these layers. The discrepancy observed for the layer 11 is most likely due to an electronic problem in the TDC voltage ramp of all the chips on that layer. But the reason is not totally clear and identified.

\end{figure}

\section{Corrections applied to data}

\subsection{Ramp non-linearity correction}
\label{subsec:lin_corr}

The calibration relies on the linearity of the TDC voltage ramp in the \textit{SPIROC2B} by measuring the minimum and maximum of the ramp and interpolating the slope assuming a linear ramp. This assumption is not entirely reliable as described in \cite{Hartbrich2011, Brianne2012}. The voltage slope shows a slight kink around the middle leading to a non-linear ramp. For this, a correction of the non-linearity is applied. Since also the time reference is determined from a ramp with a kink and can't be corrected due to the lack of external time reference, the position of $T_{ref}$ and $T_{hit}$ on the ramp is actually corrected here.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\textwidth}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{\subref{fig:LinCorr}) Typical profile of the time of the hit versus the TDC of the hit before the non-linearity correction. The graph is slightly curved showing that this chip presents a non-linear TDC ramp. The $\chi^2/ndf$ of the fit is 1.29. \subref{fig:LinCorr_2}) The correction parameters are applied then on the data to cross-check the quality of the correction. One can see that the curve flattens with the correction applied.}
\end{figure}

By looking at the time of the first hit (T$_{fH}$) for each chip and BXID versus the TDC value of the hit, the shape of the graph indicates how reliable is the assumption of a linear ramp. If the ramp would be perfectly linear, one would obtain a flat graph. To correct for the non-linearity of the ramp, a quadratic fit is performed for each chip and \acrshort{bxid} as shown in figure \ref{fig:LinCorr}. The correction needed can be in the order of few nanoseconds. The figure \ref{fig:LinCorr_2} shows the time of first hit as a function of the TDC value of the hit after the correction, the graph looks much flatter.

The non-linearity correction results in an improvement in the timing resolution (RMS) of the AHCAL of about 5.1\% (from 5.65 to 5.36 ns) as shown in figure \ref{fig:timing_lincorrection}. The asymmetry of the time distribution remains and is most likely due to the time reference which is not corrected for the non-linearity as no external time reference for these channels is present. Looking at each layer, as shown in figure \ref{fig:reso_lincorrection}, the time resolution went down by the same amount.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Time Walk correction}
\label{subsec:timewalk}

The time-walk effect is due to the presence of a threshold that induces a time shift between a small amplitude signal and a high amplitude signal. Small amplitude signals will systematically trigger at a later time than high amplitude signals. A correction can be applied to the data by looking at the time of the first hit versus the amplitude of the hit. This might be particularly important for late neutrons signals that generally deposit very little energy in the calorimeter.

The correction is assumed to be the same for all the chips, independent of the position of the threshold of each chip, as hits are cut at 0.5 MIP. Thresholds of most of the chips were set to similar values and the threshold was set-up well below 0.5 MIP. An exponential fit of the form $\text{A} \times e^{-\lambda{}x} + \text{B}$ is performed on the data to extract the parameters needed to correct the time walk effect as shown on figure \ref{fig:time_walk}. The residuals after correction are in the order of few hundreds of picoseconds as seen in figure \ref{fig:time_walk_corr}.

A difference up to 6 ns is seen between small and large amplitudes. \subref{fig:time_walk_corr}) Time-walk profile after correction showing a spread of less than 1 ns.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Time of first hit for muons after corrections}
\label{subsec:Muon_final}

After the time-walk correction, an improvement of around 3\% can be achieved on the time resolution of the AHCAL as shown in figure \ref{fig:timing_muons}. The figure \ref{fig:timing_reso_all_muons} shows the time resolution obtained for all the layers in the AHCAL. The obtained time resolution is around 5.2 ns RMS. The distribution is still asymmetric and it is taken into account in the simulation by parametrizing the time distribution with a double Gaussian function (see table \ref{table:time_res_sim}). The number of events identified later than 5$\sigma$ ($\sim$ 25 ns) is around 1.22\% giving a good assessment of the noise suppression for muons.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../Thesis_Plots/Timing/Muons/Plots/Timing_AllLayers.pdf}

\end{figure}

After all corrections, the time resolution obtained is far from the 1 ns time resolution desired which is most likely due to the domination in the time resolution of the time reference. Assuming that it is a simple convolution of the time resolution of the AHCAL and the resolution of the time reference, then the AHCAL time resolution would be around $\sigma_{AHCAL} \sim \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{t}^2 - \sigma_{Tref}^2}{3}} \sim$ 1.91 ns which is consistent with previous measurements of single-channel time resolution \cite{Laurien2016}.

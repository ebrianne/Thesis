\chapter{AHCAL Testbeam setup \& Event Selection}
\label{chap:EvtSelection}

The dataset analyzed in this thesis has been recorded with the AHCAL technological prototype described in section \ref{sec:AHCAL} in July 2015.

The main topic of this analysis presented in this thesis is the study of the \textit{time development of hadronic showers} and the study of the \textit{effects of timing cuts} in a hadronic calorimeter. The analysis is divided in several part with the following strategy:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Energy scale calibration of the AHCAL prototype in chapter \ref{chap:ECalibAHCAL}.
	\item Determination of the time calibration constants in chapter \ref{chap:TimingCalib}.
	\item Validation of the time calibration in chapter \ref{chap:TimingValidation}.
	\item Analysis of the recorded pion data in chapter \ref{chap:TimingPions}.
\end{itemize}

This chapter discusses the setup of the testbeam first before presenting the selected dataset for this analysis, the selection of the triggers needed for this analysis as time reference and the selection criteria for each dataset of muons, electrons and pions.

\section{Testbeam Configuration}

\subsection{Beamline Setup}
\label{sec:beamline}

During the summer of 2015, the CALICE collaboration performed several testbeam campaigns with the AHCAL technological prototype. The detector was installed in the beamline H2 at the North Area beamline at CERN \cite{H2Beamline}. The beamline provided wire chambers and scintillators that enabled us to have information about the beam position and number of particles but unfortunately, this information could not be recorded with the AHCAL data acquisition system. The information collected about the amount of material upstream of the detector until the last momentum selection magnet is limited.

A Cherenkov detector (at around 100 m upstream) was available to tag incoming particles. These detectors take advantage of the fact that, a particle that traverses a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium will generate a cone of Cherenkov light. The opening angle of the cone is proportional to the particle mass \cite{GOVORKOV20059}. The Cherenkov detector at this beamline offered the possibility to set a threshold for particle tagging. This is particularly needed to tag electrons in a pion beam. The tagging signal from the Cherenkov detector was provided directly to several AHCAL channels.

For the production of particles, a primary high-intensity proton beam (around $10^{12}$ protons per burst) of 400 GeV impinges on a target. From this, a secondary beam is produced containing various particle types and energies.

A muon beam can be obtained by the decay of a collimated pion beam which are stopped by a collimator before the last bending magnet.

For electrons, a neutral beam of photons is directed to a lead target to generate electrons from gamma conversion, producing a very pure electron beam. Another possibility is to impinge a charged beam onto a secondary target and filter the beam with an absorber. But this has the disadvantage of low rates at low energy and possible contamination of the electron beam with pions.

For pions, the momentum is selected via a set of collimators and magnets. Due to the decay of $\pi_0$ (conversion of the photons into the absorber filter) and the acceptance of the beamline, a contamination of the pion beam with electrons is possible at low momentum (< 20 GeV).

\subsection{Testbeam Setup}
\label{sec:TBsetup}

In July 2015, the AHCAL detector is using the full EUDET steel stack \cite{EUDET-Report-2010-02} with 48 iron absorber plates. In the stack, 14 active layers are installed as shown in figures \ref{fig:Det_layout} and \ref{fig:AHCAL_photo}. The detector is placed on a movable stage in order to be able to move the detector position relative to the beam for muon calibration runs.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{chap5/fig_EnergyCalib/Detector_layout.png}
	\caption{Simplified view of the detector layout used in July 2015.} \label{fig:Det_layout}
\end{figure}

The beam instrumentation consists of two $10\times10$ cm$^2$ scintillator plates in front of the calorimeter, and as well as two $50\times50$ cm$^2$ scintillator plates in front and back of the calorimeter. They are read-out by photomultiplier tubes. The coincidence of the $50\times50$ cm$^2$ scintillator plates is used for the muon runs and the coincidence of the $10\times10$ cm$^2$ scintillator plates is used for the electron and pion runs as trigger signal. Additionally, the coincidence signal from the scintillator is provided directly to several channels of the AHCAL in order to provide a reference time for the trigger which is important in this analysis (see section \ref{subsec:trigger}).

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{chap5/fig_EnergyCalib/IMG_1170.jpg}
	\caption{Photo of the AHCAL detector before the installation in the testbeam area.} \label{fig:AHCAL_photo}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Trigger Signals}
\label{subsec:trigger}

As explained in section \ref{sec:TBsetup}, the scintillator plates are used as trigger signal. The scintillators plates are connected to a discriminator and a gate for coincidence in order to provide a validation signal to the SPIROC ASIC (see section \ref{sec:SPIROC2B}).

When a coincidence happens, a SiPM-like signal, 4 $\mu$s length with a fast rising edge of around 1 ns, is generated with an amplitude around 100 mV that is used as a trigger time reference. This signal is injected directly to six AHCAL channels to provide redundancy. The list of the channels used are shown in table \ref{table:trigger_signal_list}. No other external time reference than these channels is available.

\begin{table}[htb!]
	\centering
	\caption{List of AHCAL channels with the injected trigger signal used as time reference for this analysis.}
	\label{table:trigger_signal_list}
	\begin{tabular}{@{} ccccc @{}}
		\toprule
		Layer \# & Chip Number & Channel & Comments & Name \\
		\midrule
		11 & 169 & 29 & noisy & T$_{11}$ \\
		11 & 177 & 23 & broken & - \\
		12 & 185 & 29 & - & T$_{12}$ \\
		13 & 201 & 29 & -  & T$_{13}$ \\
		13 & 211 & 6 & broken & - \\
		14 & 217 & 23 & - & T$_{14}$ \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In the following analysis, the time reference signals T$_{12}$, T$_{13}$ and T$_{14}$ are used. The channels are determined to be noisy or broken by looking at the energy spectra of these channels. Broken channels results in an empty energy spectrum and noisy channels are showing two energy peaks, one near the pedestal and another at the expected energy value.

\section{Dataset and Event Selection}

The selections presented in this section are based on simulated data. To ensure a proper simulation, a careful validation of the simulation has been performed. The validation of the simulation can be seen in appendix \ref{appendix:SimulationVal}.

\subsection{Dataset}
\label{subsec:dataset}

During the campaign at \acrshort{sps} in July 2015, muon runs were taken at 50 GeV and 150 GeV beam energy for the calibration of the detector. Several electron runs were taken at beam energies between 10 GeV and 50 GeV to study the electromagnetic response of the calorimeter. For the electron runs, the beam was generated by directing a neutral beam directly on a lead converter target therefore the electron beam was pure. Finally, the pion runs were taken at beam energies between 10 GeV and 90 GeV.

The table \ref{table:dataruns} sums up the dataset taken. The number of events shown in the table is the total number of recorded events.

		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{MIP Pre-selection}
\label{subsec:Muon_presel}

A clean selection of MIP tracks is needed in order to obtain and cross-check the MIP calibration (see chapter \ref{chap:ECalibAHCAL}) and as well performing the timing calibration of the detector (see chapter \ref{chap:TimingCalib}) at a single cell level. A simple pre-selection was performed on the muon sample designed to select effectively MIP-like particles going through the AHCAL. In a second step, a track selection was performed to retain only MIP-like particle as explained in section \ref{subsec:Muon_sel}.

The pre-selection is based on the energy weighted center of gravity along the z-axis $cog_Z = \frac{\Sigma{i} E_i z_i}{\Sigma_{i} E_i}$ and the number of hits $n_{Hits}$. A MIP-like particle should, in principle, deposit the same energy in each layer of the calorimeter thus $cog_Z$ should be roughly centered in the calorimeter in the z coordinate. In addition, the number of hits should be around 1 per layer for a MIP-like particle plus the number of noise hits expected in the detector, therefore explaining a cut at $n_{Hits} = 20$.

The distribution in the plane $cog_Z$:$n_{Hits}$ is obtained from simulated 150 GeV muons, electrons and pions and the applied pre-selection is shown in figure \ref{fig:Muons_CoGZ_nHits}. The pre-selection efficiency is 99.4\% for muons, 0\% for electrons and 13.3\% for pions.

	\caption{Event distribution in $cog_Z:n_{Hits}$ plane. The black box represents the space-phase covered by the pre-selection.} \label{fig:Muons_CoGZ_nHits}
\end{figure}

\subsection{MIP Selection}
\label{subsec:Muon_sel}

The muon runs were taken first at 50 GeV then more runs at the end of the campaign were performed at 150 GeV. After investigation, muon runs were contaminated by pions. It is estimated that around 30\% of the vents are contaminated by pions by looking at the spectrum of the number of hits per event.

The MIP selection was designed to efficiently select muons and reject late pion showers. For this, a MIP track finder has been developed based on pre-existing work \cite{Hartbrich:2016bbz}. The algorithm selects AHCAL towers of hits in the same $x:y$ position and it rejects AHCAL towers that contains less than a certain number of hits. In order to select muons or punch-through pions, a straight track of at least 7 hits is required in the whole AHCAL. This assumes that the calorimeter was perfectly perpendicular to the beam, therefore any tilted tracks would be missed. In addition, to reject late pion showers, no more than 2 hits are allowed per layer to account for some flexibility with noise hits.

The distributions of the maximum number of hits in a layer and the number of hits of a track are shown in figures \ref{fig:Muons_Track_nHitsLayer} and \ref{fig:Muons_Track_nHits} for simulated samples of 150 GeV muons, electrons and pions after pre-selection. The MIP track finder was performed in two steps for the inner part of the detector of $12 \times 12$ tiles and the outer part for layers 11 to 14 (Outer BL) in order to calibrate the outer channels of these layers.

The selection efficiency is 72.5\% for muons, 0\% for electrons and 5.6\% for pions. The selection reduces further the pion contamination and the remaining pion fraction is compatible with the fraction of pions traversing the AHCAL without hard interaction by calculation. A detailed overview of the MIP selection is given in table \ref{table:muon_sel}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Electron Selection}
\label{subsec:elec_sel}

The electron selection is done to extract single electron showers contained in the AHCAL. These events are needed in order to validate the timing behavior in simulation as well as the detector simulation model as explained in chapter \ref{chap:TimingValidation}. It is important to have a clean sample of electrons to cross-check the timing calibration. For the selection, an \textit{Event Quality} pre-selection is done using the beam instrumentation and layer information. Events with a Cherenkov tag (only applied to data) are used and the energy in the three first layers of the AHCAL ($E_3+E_4+E_5$) must be over 10 MIPs. The distributions of the energy in the three first layer of the AHCAL for simulated 10 and 50 GeV muons, electrons and pions can be seen in figures \ref{fig:e10GeV_E3} and \ref{fig:e50GeV_E3}.

In a next step, the electron selection is performed. Due to the number of unusable layers especially with the front ECAL layers (see section \ref{subsec:ScECAL}) and the fact that the detector is not fully equipped, an alternative selection needed to be performed to effectively select electrons. As no look into calorimeter linearity and energy resolution is done in this thesis, a cut on the number of hits per event ($n_{Hits}$) versus the center of gravity in z ($CoG_Z < 250 mm$) can be done. This does not induce any bias for a timing analysis, it would only reduce the event statistics.

To ensure a complete containment of the shower and a rejection of possible pion showers, an additional cut on the energy deposited in the last two layers relative to the energy deposited in the calorimeter ($(E_{13}+E_{14})/\Sigma E$) is done and is required to be under 1\%. The distributions of each variables used in the selection are shown in figures \ref{fig:electronselection} for simulated 10 GeV and 50 GeV muons, electrons and pions. Due to the restriction on the number of hits per event, the cuts are energy dependent. Additionally, to reduce transverse leakage, the shower center of gravity in X and Y needs to be within -90 mm and 90 mm. This cut is wider than the trigger scintillator but has no significant impact.

The selection cuts are summarized in table \ref{table:electron_sel} for each energy. The selection efficiencies for beam energies between 10 and 50 GeV are shown in table \ref{table:eff_electron} obtained from simulated samples of muons, electrons and pions with the QGSP\_BERT\_HP physics list.

\begin{table}[htb!]

	\caption{Efficiency of the electron selection for simulated electrons, muons and pions for energies between 10 and 50 GeV.}
	\label{table:eff_electron}
	\begin{tabular}{@{} llll @{}}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Beam Energy} & \textbf{$\epsilon_{\mu}$} & \textbf{$\epsilon_{e}$} & \textbf{$\epsilon_{\pi}$}\\
		\midrule
		10 GeV & <0.1\% & 96\% & 15.9\%\\
		15 GeV & <0.1\% & 95.7\% & 10.1\%\\
		20 GeV & <0.1\% & 95.2\% & 6.3\%\\
		30 GeV & <0.1\% & 93.9\% & 2.3\%\\
		40 GeV & <0.1\% & 92.7\% & 1.2\%\\
		50 GeV & <0.1\% & 91.5\% & 1.1\%\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

One can notice that a significant fraction of pions is present at low beam energies (10 to 20 GeV). But as the production of electrons in the beamline was done using a beam of photons on a beryllium target, it is believed that there is no pion contamination in the data. Thus no additional cut is needed.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Pion Selection}
\label{sec:pionsel}

The goal of the pion selection is to reject punch-through pions, muons and possible electron contamination as these events would be instantaneous (see section \ref{sec:TimeDevShowers}). An \textit{Event Quality} pre-selection is performed using the Cherenkov information. The events without a Cherenkov tag are selected. This is only applied to data. The pion selection is based on the same variables as the electron selection: $cog_Z:n_{Hits}$ plane, $(E_{13}+E_{14})/\Sigma E$ and additionally the number of hits in two first AHCAL layers ($N_3+N_4$).

The number of hits required per event needs to be over 20 to reject most muons or punch-through pions without cutting on the center of gravity in z in order not to bias the selection on the start of the pion shower. To ensure that the pion showered, the energy in the last two layers of the AHCAL must be over 1\%. And finally, to mitigate possible particle contamination from electrons, the number of hits in the two first AHCAL layer must be under 5.

The distributions of each variable used in the selection are shown in figures \ref{fig:pionselection} for simulated 10 GeV and 90 GeV muons, electrons and pions. The selection efficiencies for beam energies between 10 and 90 GeV are shown in table \ref{table:eff_pion} obtained from simulated samples of muons, electrons and pions with the QGSP\_BERT\_HP physics list.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{chap5/fig_AHCAL_timing/Pions/DoubleParticleEventPions.png}
	\caption{Multi-particle event in the 50 GeV pion data sample. The color represents the time of the hit.} \label{fig:DoubleParticleEvent}
\end{figure}

In addition, after a long investigation, multiple particle events were observed in the data as shown in figure \ref{fig:DoubleParticleEvent}. As no beam instrumentation could be used for rejecting these events, a rejection method based using time information was developed.

This method is the following: all the hits in an event are placed and ordered in time; Then for each hit after 50 ns, a timing window of 30 ns is looked after and the number of hits in that window is counted. If the number of hits is over 5, it is counted as a \textit{late cluster}. The event is rejected if there is at least one late cluster. This method works because if an event has several particles, the time reference of the event is generated by the first particle. Therefore, the second particle will have all the hits late relative to the time reference and thus the event will be rejected with this method.

The method was based on data in order to remove efficiently multi-particle events. The multi-particle event rejection has been checked on simulated data and affects the selection between <0.1\% up to 2\% from 10 to 90 GeV pions. These multi-particle events are greatly suppressed in data using this method but due to the calorimeter not being fully equipped, some contamination may remain in the data.

A detailed description of the selection cuts are shown in table \ref{table:pion_sel}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Chip rejection}
\label{sec:ChipRejection}

A careful check of each chip has been performed to reject any outlier. For all the data collected, the layer 11 is rejected due to a likely problem with the electronics (see section \ref{subsec:slope_calib}). For the muon data, a single chip (157) shows a strange behavior likely because the input DAC on this chip is broken resulting in an unstable voltage applied to the SiPM.

For the electron data, a relative fraction of hits $r$ following the equation \ref{eq:fraction_rejection} was used to determine bad behaving chips. If this fraction $r$ is below 98\%, the chip is rejected. This means that most of the hits in the event are outside of the core of the distribution between -50 and 50 ns. With this method, 20 chips are rejected.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fraction_rejection}
	r = \frac{1}{N} \left|\int_{50 ns}^{200 ns} \frac{dN(t)}{dt} dt - \int_{-200 ns}^{50 ns} \frac{dN(t)}{dt} dt\right|
\end{equation}

For the pion data, applying the same method as for electrons is not possible due to a late tail to higher time related to delayed energy depositions from neutrons. The same chips as for electrons were rejected but in addition, each chip time distribution after correction were manually checked. The chips that presented an abnormal shape such as double peaks were discarded. Hence, 16 chips are additionally rejected.

This leaves 44 chips in the pion analysis. A detailed table of the rejected chips can be seen in appendix \ref{appendix:rejection}.

In this chapter, the dataset used for this thesis, the selection criteria for each type of data and the rejection criteria have been presented. Before performing the timing analysis of the recorded data and to do a meaningful comparison of the results to simulations, accurate data calibration factors and a realistic AHCAL simulation model is essential. Therefore, in the next chapter, the energy scale calibration of the AHCAL prototype is presented.

\chapter{Influence of the number of triggered channels and parametrization in Monte-Carlo.}
\label{appendix:ped_shift}

The correction applied function of the number of hits above 0.5 MIPs is only a global correction not an event to event basis correction. Thus a part of the effect remains in the time distribution or it may be another effect from the electronics that is not yet identified.\\
The effect can be clearly seen in figure \ref{fig:ped_shift_dist_para}. This effect has to be implemented in the simulation in order to match the timing distribution of electrons without also influencing the time distribution for muons. A parametrization is thus implemented in the Monte-Carlo extracted from data. This parametrization assumes the following, the effect is in addition to the seen muon resolution giving then:
\begin{equation*}
	\text{RMS}_{\text{obs}}^2 = \text{RMS}_{\mu}^2 + \text{RMS}_{\text{effect}}^2
\end{equation*}
The $\text{RMS}_{\text{effect}}$ is extracted from data by fitting with a function of the following form:
\begin{equation*}
	f(t) = A \times e^{-\frac{(t-\mu_1)^2}{2(\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_{effect}^2)}} + B* \times e^{-\frac{(t-\mu_2)^2}{2(\sigma_2^2 + \sigma_{effect}^2)}} + C
\end{equation*}

The parameters $\mu_1$, $\sigma_1$, $\mu_2$ and $\sigma_2$ are fixed from table \ref{table:time_res_sim}. By plotting $\sigma_{effect}$ extracted as a function of the number of triggered channels in a chip, one can extract the parametrization of the effect. This is done for each electron energy point as shown in figure \ref{fig:para_fit}. One can observe that each parametrization curve is slightly different for each energy. This may be due to the fact that each energy affects not exactly the same part of the detector.
The 50 GeV parametrization looks very different than the others. All time distributions for all chips and layers have been investigated manually in order to understand the different but no clear reason has been found.

To accommodate this, a mean parametrization is used in Monte-Carlo with the envelope used as uncertainty as shown in figure \ref{fig:mean_para}. Only points up to 10-11 number of channels are extracted from data. Above this, the value of $\sigma_{effect}$ is extrapolated. This should in principle have relatively a small effect for electrons as mainly 6-10 hits are expected per chip. But the effect may be relevant for pions.

title       = {SGV 3.0 - a fast detector simulation},
abstract    = {The need for fast simulation programs is emphasised, both in terms of the need for "rapid response" to new results - in particular from the LHC - and new theoretical ideas, and in terms of how to cope with multi-billion simulated event samples. The latter would arise both from the need to be able to simulate significantly more events than expected in the real data, also for high cross-section processes, and the need to scan multi-parameter theories. The {\it Simulation \`a Grande Vitesse}, SGV, is presented, and is shown to be able to address these issues. The tracking performance of SGV is shown to reproduce very closely that of the full simulation and reconstruction of the ILD concept. Preliminary results on how to also closely emulate the calorimetric performance from full simulation is presented. The procedure is parametric, with no the need to simulate the detailed shower development, and promises to be many orders of magnitude faster than such approaches. Contrary to what is often the case with fast simulation programs, the procedure gives a somewhat {\it pessimistic} result, compared to the full simulation and reconstruction.},

title       = {The Pandora Particle Flow Algorithm},
abstract    = {A high-energy e+e- collider, such as the ILC or CLIC, is arguably the best option to complement and extend the LHC physics programme. A lepton collider will allow for exploration of Standard Model Physics, such as precise measurements of the Higgs, top and gauge sectors, in addition to enabling a multitude of New Physics searches. However, physics analyses at such a collider will place unprecedented demands on calorimetry, with a required jet energy resolution of \sigma(E)/E < 3.5%. To meet these requirements will need a new approach to calorimetry. The particle flow approach to calorimetry requires both fine granularity detectors and sophisticated software algorithms. It promises to deliver unparalleled jet energy resolution by fully reconstructing the paths of individual particles through the detector. The energies of charged particles can then be extracted from precise inner detector tracker measurements, whilst photon energies will be measured in the ECAL, and only neutral hadron energies (10% of jet energies) will be measured in the HCAL, largely avoiding the typically poor HCAL resolution. This document introduces the Pandora particle flow algorithms, which offer the current state of the art in particle flow calorimetry for the ILC and CLIC. The performance of the algorithms is investigated by examining the reconstructed jet energy resolution and the ability to separate the hadronic decays of W and Z bosons.},

We describe the principles of operation and the usage of this program to simulate the response of a detector for the TESLA linear collider. The detector components are implemented according to the TESLA Technical Design Report. All detector component responses are treated in a realistic way using a parametrisation of results from the {\em ab initio} Monte Carlo program \verb+BRAHMS+. Pattern recognition is emulated using a complete cross reference between generated particles and detector response. Also, for charged particles, the covariance matrix and $dE/dx$ information are made available. An idealised energy flow algorithm defines the output of the program, consisting of particles generically classified as electrons, photons, muons, charged and neutral hadrons as well as unresolved clusters. The program parameters adjustable by the user are described in detail. User hooks inside the program and the output data structure are documented.},

title       = {Kalman-filter-based track fitting in non-uniform magnetic field with segment-wise helical track model},
abstract    = {In the future International Linear Collider (ILC) experiment, high performance tracking is essential to its physics program including precision Higgs studies. One of major challenges for a detector such as the proposed International Large Detector (ILD) is to provide excellent momentum resolution in a magnetic filed with small (but non-negligible) non-uniformity. The non-uniform magnetic field implies deviation from a helical track and hence requires the extension of a helical track model used for track fitting in a uniform magnetic field. In this paper, a segment-wise helical track model is introduced as such an extension. The segment-wise helical track model approximates the magnetic field between two nearby measurement sites to be uniform and steps between the two sites along a helix. The helix frame is then transformed according to the new magnetic field direction for the next step, so as to take into account the non-uniformity of the magnetic field. Details of the algorithm and mathematical aspects of the segment-wise helical track model in a Kalman-filter-based track fitting in the non-uniform magnetic field are elaborated. The new track model is implemented and successfully tested in the framework of the Kalman filter tracking software package, KalTest, which was originally developed for tracking in a uniform magnetic field.},

A comprehensive value estimate of the accelerator is give, together with associated uncertainties. It is shown that no significant technical issues remain to be solved. Once a site is selected and the necessary site-dependent engineering is carried out, construction can begin immediately. The TDR also gives baseline documentation for two high-performance detectors that can share the ILC luminosity by being moved into and out of the beam line in a "push-pull" configuration. These detectors, ILD and SiD, are described in detail. They form the basis for a world-class experimental programme that promises to increase significantly our understanding of the fundamental processes that govern the evolution of the Universe.},

title       = {String Parton Models in Geant4},
abstract    = {Dual parton and quark gluon string model are the by now almost standard theoretical techniques by which one can arrive at precision description of high energy, soft, inclusive reactions. These reactions make the part of jets at energies that contribute strongly to discovery channels such as H$\to$WWjj, or search for compositeness at the highest transverse momenta. The above modeling approach is available with Geant4 for nucleon induced reactions since the first release. Its object oriented design and parameter set was recently extended to allow for simulation of pion and kaon induced reactions, as well as heavy ion reactions. We will briefly describe the theory and algorithmic approaches that underly the modeling, show the object oriented designs and component structure of the string parton sub-systems of Geant4, present validation/verification results pertaining to these models, as well as results concerning their usage in calorimeter simulation.},

abstract = {The goal of the T3B experiment is the measurement of the time structure of hadronic showers with nanosecond precision and high spatial resolution together with the CALICE hadron calorimeter prototypes, with a focus on the use of tungsten as absorber medium. The detector consists of a strip of 15 scintillator cells individually read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and fast oscilloscopes with a PC-controlled data acquisition system. The data reconstruction uses an iterative subtraction technique which provides a determination of the arrival time of each photon on the light sensor with sub-nanosecond precision. The calibration is based on single photon-equivalent dark pulses constantly recorded during data taking, automatically eliminating the temperature dependence of the SiPM gain. In addition, a statistical correction for SiPM afterpulsing is demonstrated. To provide the tools for a comparison of T3B data with GEANT4 simulations, a digitization routine, which accounts for the detector response to energy deposits in the detector, has been implemented.},

\chapter{Introduction}

This thesis is based on the analysis of testbeam data of the CALICE AHCAL technological prototype. In Chapter 1, the theoretical foundations for this thesis are summarized. In Chapter 2, the International Linear Collider, the foreseen detectors and the physics program are presented. In Chapter 3, the principles of calorimetry are presented and the principle of Particle Flow is discussed. The CALICE prototypes are introduced and compared in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, the particle shower models in \geant4 are presented along with the AHCAL simulation model implementation and digitization procedure. The commissioning procedure of the AHCAL technological prototype is introduced and discussed in Chapter 6. In Chapter 7, the testbeam setup and event selections are described. The energy scale calibration of the AHCAL is discussed in Chapter 8. In Chapter 9 and 10, the timing analysis of the testbeam is presented, discussed and compared to simulations. Finally, in Chapter 11, the effects of timing cuts in the ILD detector simulation are investigated and discussed.

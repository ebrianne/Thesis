  title       = {SGV 3.0 - a fast detector simulation},
  abstract    = {The need for fast simulation programs is emphasised, both in terms of the need for "rapid response" to new results - in particular from the LHC - and new theoretical ideas, and in terms of how to cope with multi-billion simulated event samples. The latter would arise both from the need to be able to simulate significantly more events than expected in the real data, also for high cross-section processes, and the need to scan multi-parameter theories. The {\it Simulation \`a Grande Vitesse}, SGV, is presented, and is shown to be able to address these issues. The tracking performance of SGV is shown to reproduce very closely that of the full simulation and reconstruction of the ILD concept. Preliminary results on how to also closely emulate the calorimetric performance from full simulation is presented. The procedure is parametric, with no the need to simulate the detailed shower development, and promises to be many orders of magnitude faster than such approaches. Contrary to what is often the case with fast simulation programs, the procedure gives a somewhat {\it pessimistic} result, compared to the full simulation and reconstruction.},

  title       = {The Pandora Particle Flow Algorithm},
  abstract    = {A high-energy e+e- collider, such as the ILC or CLIC, is arguably the best option to complement and extend the LHC physics programme. A lepton collider will allow for exploration of Standard Model Physics, such as precise measurements of the Higgs, top and gauge sectors, in addition to enabling a multitude of New Physics searches. However, physics analyses at such a collider will place unprecedented demands on calorimetry, with a required jet energy resolution of \sigma(E)/E < 3.5%. To meet these requirements will need a new approach to calorimetry. The particle flow approach to calorimetry requires both fine granularity detectors and sophisticated software algorithms. It promises to deliver unparalleled jet energy resolution by fully reconstructing the paths of individual particles through the detector. The energies of charged particles can then be extracted from precise inner detector tracker measurements, whilst photon energies will be measured in the ECAL, and only neutral hadron energies (10% of jet energies) will be measured in the HCAL, largely avoiding the typically poor HCAL resolution. This document introduces the Pandora particle flow algorithms, which offer the current state of the art in particle flow calorimetry for the ILC and CLIC. The performance of the algorithms is investigated by examining the reconstructed jet energy resolution and the ability to separate the hadronic decays of W and Z bosons.},
